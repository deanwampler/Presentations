# Dean Wampler's Presentations

This repo contains some of the presentations I've given over the years at conferences, user groups, etc. Not all of them are here yet. You can find all of them at [polyglotprogramming.com/talks](http://polyglotprogramming.com/talks "talks").

Unless otherwise noted, all content is covered by the Creative Commons License [CC-by-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Most of the files are Apple Keynote and PDF files, and they are larger than the 50MB limit GitHub prefers for files. So, this repository uses [Git Large File Storage](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage), which you should install before cloning this repo.
