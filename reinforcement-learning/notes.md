### Applications of RL

There is a growing number of RL applications today.

* Games: Googleâ€™s AlphaGo, released in 2016, which famously beat the 18-time world champion, Lee Sedol, in the game of Go.
* Robotics and autonomous vehicles: simulated locomotion, real-world robotic manipulation, mobility, pick and place.
* Industrial control: We can teach a policy to optimize datacenter cooling and its energy consumption, factory floors (Ford assembly line, credit: https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/features/game-changer--100th-anniversary-of-the-moving-assembly-line.html)
* System optimization: optimize database queries, cooling (Google datacenter photo: https://www.blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/better-data-centers-through-machine/, patch cabling photo: https://flickr.com/photos/jerryjohn)
* Advertising, recommendations (Video recommendations on YouTube diagram: https://research.google/pubs/pub45530/)
* Finance (photo: http://tradinghub.co/watch-list-for-mar-26th-2015/)
